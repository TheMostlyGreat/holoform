# Communication Agent Project Plan

## Goal
Create a conversational AI agent that unifies all communication channels (Gmail, Slack, SMS, LinkedIn, etc.) into a single, intelligently prioritized queue, helping users overcome communication overload by surfacing only the most important messages and providing an AI-assisted workflow to efficiently process each one.

## Pain Point
Communication overload across multiple platforms makes it impossible to keep up with important messages. Traditional filtering (spam, newsletters) only removes noise but doesn't help identify and process the signal. Users need an intelligent system that:
- Surfaces truly important messages across all channels
- Provides context and assistance for each message
- Streamlines the response process with AI-driven workflows
- Reduces cognitive load through intelligent prioritization

## Product Vision

### Core Experience
A Cursor-like interface with:
- **Left Pane**: Conversational AI agent that guides the workflow
- **Middle Pane**: Current message "card" being processed
- **Right Pane**: Contextual information (full inbox, related messages, or analytics)

### Workflow
1. **Unified Queue**: Top 10 (configurable) messages ranked by importance/urgency across all channels
2. **Card-by-Card Processing**: Agent presents one message at a time
3. **Micro-Questions**: 1-3 contextual questions to help draft responses or take actions
4. **Action Options**: Process now, snooze, skip, or schedule for later
5. **Context-Aware**: Agent pre-fetches relevant context for important messages
