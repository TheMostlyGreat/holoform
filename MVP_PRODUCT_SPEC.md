# Risk Mitigation

## Critical Risks
1. **AI Quality**: Test with 100+ real emails before launch
2. **Gmail API Limits**: Implement caching, batch requests
3. **Cost Management**: Monitor GPT-4 usage, set limits
4. **User Trust**: Clear data privacy policy, no auto-send

## Quick Wins
1. **Instant Value**: Show important emails immediately
2. **Perfect Defaults**: 3 drafts always ready
3. **Social Proof**: "Join 500+ professionals"
4. **Viral Signature**: Every email markets product

# Success Criteria

## MVP is successful if:
- ✅ Users say "holy shit" in first 30 seconds
- ✅ 70% of trial users send at least 5 emails
- ✅ 30% convert to paid after trial
- ✅ Users organically share with colleagues
- ✅ Time-to-value is under 2 minutes

## MVP fails if:
- ❌ AI drafts need heavy editing
- ❌ Gmail sync is slow or buggy
- ❌ Users don't trust AI with sending
- ❌ Value isn't immediately obvious
- ❌ Too complex to onboard

---

# Next Steps

1. **Validate** this spec with 5 potential users
2. **Design** simple wireframes (2 days max)
3. **Build** core flow first (Gmail → Queue → Draft → Send)
4. **Test** with real emails immediately
5. **Ship** when 10 beta users say "I need this"

Remember: The goal is to prove people will pay $30/month to never have writer's block again. Everything else can wait.
